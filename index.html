        <p class="excerpt">I had a thought after <a href="http://sourcegate.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/starting-on-the-vsync-interrupts/">my previous disheartening attempt to get the vsync working</a>: since they might have stuffed up timer 11 in ChibiOS, I might change to timer 4.  One massive advantage is that timers 2, 3 and 4 have 4 compare registers, instead of one!  This means I can use one to turn off the vsync pulse, and one to trigger the DMA interrupt and adjust the sync timings on the next line.  Changing everything to use TIM4 was fairly straightforward, the only tricky part being changing the single compare register to use compare register 4, and enabling APB1 instead of APB2 since that’s where timer 4 is.  (I originally used register 1, but that is connected to PORTB6 which is attached to the blue LED.)

        <p class="excerpt">Now it’s time to adjust the sync signals to get vsync working, so I need an interrupt when the signal goes low so I can adjust the sync pulse on the next cycle.  I have no idea how to start the interrupts.

Here’s the first drawing from my whiteboard robot! It doesn’t draw anything by itself because I must have messed up the maths, but I was able to operate it manually and draw some circles. The lines are wonky because the wall the board was attached to was shaking. I didn’t get the pen to move in and out, to draw separate lines.

        <p class="excerpt">This article describes how to run one of the <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html">V-USB</a> demos on an <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9147">AVR stick</a> (which is an <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/easylogger.html">Easylogger</a> clone).

        <span class="post-date">2011-12-11</span>
        <p class="excerpt">My cheap kettle leaked.  You couldn’t press the lever down when it wasn’t on the base, so I hoped to find an electromagnet which held the switch on when it had power.  I didn’t find one (I only managed to salvage two neon lights from it), but I found out how kettles switch off when they’re boiling.

        <p class="excerpt">If you’re running some command that takes a while, perhaps compressing a large file, you often want to know how far along it is.  This is when the <code>/proc/_pid_/io</code> file is useful.

        <p class="excerpt">Well, not really offline since you’ll still have to download some files, but not all of the packages.  Use this for computers with limited internet quota.  I’m sure this could be done in a single script with some awk-fu.
